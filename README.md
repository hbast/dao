# DAO - DocBook Accessibility Optimizer for Apache FOP

DAO is a script written in Python that optimizes the \<fo:block\> structures in the XSL-FO code generated by docbook-xsl. The optimized XSL-FO code can then be used with FOP for generating tagged PDF. The tag structure of the PDF will be as flat as possible.

## Introduction
Apache FOP can be used to generate tagged PDF from XSL-FO code. Using DocBook XML in conjunction with the official DocBook-XSL files leads to the problem that deep nested \<fo:block\> structures are generated. Because FOP automatically tags every \<fo:block\> as paragraph (PDF tag 'P'), the resulting PDF tag structure looks pretty 'weak'.

DAO solves that problem by crwaling through the XSL-FO document structure and optimizing the \<fo:block\> structure.
